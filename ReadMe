Learning Notes

Script File Basics
- First two characters should be '#!'  ( #! is shebang)
- Followed by path to Bash or env:
  #! /usr/bin/env bash
  #! /bin/bash
- This is executed via the kernal system called execve()
- Kernal checks for '#!' and passes the path to the original program as a command-line argument
- Perl, Python, Execpt, awk, and Bash can use '#!'
- The env will look for Bash in your path
- '#!' /bin/bash  is most common usage


Executing the Script
- Make scripts executivable with chmod u+x
-
